# Welcome to SurvivPremium! ðŸ˜ƒ

This is a Surviv.io cheat loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by [reuke](https://github.com/reuke), transferred to [Kalaborative](https://github.com/Kalaborative) then Kalaborative quit the game. So I (Elspex) have decided to take ownership of the development of the code. 

If you like this project, and want it to last, please consider supporting.

## ðŸ¤” FAQ

> **What do I do if the cheat stops working?**

Message [FRST] Elspex#0001 on Discord if the game is updated. Wait until a new commit is pushed.

> **This feature isn't working for me!**

Some features, over time lose functionality due to the devs changing their functions in the game code. The most important features will always be available. 

> **What is "bump fire"?**

This is a feature for specific non-automatic guns (guns that you cannot hold down the left-click to shoot). By holding down left-click for these guns, they fire at the fastest rate acting like an automatic. (Think of it like an autoclicker.)

> **Are pull requests allowed?**
